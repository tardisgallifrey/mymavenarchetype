# Custom archetype to create my projects

### Creates full Maven project

This creates a full Maven project. It installs to 'local', so the Maven directive 'interactiveMode=false' will not work.  When you run a Maven generate command, it should be in the bottom of the list produced and you choose the number to the left of the archetype definition.
